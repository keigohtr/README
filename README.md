#### Vision
I want to realize the world that everyone can use algorithms easier. For this, I provided the marketplace for algorithms, named [Apitore](https://apitore.com/) as my lifework. Apitore has many computer science technologies including machine learning algorithms, and provided them as WebAPI. 

Now I am leading the project for Machine Learning managing software, named [Rekcurd](https://github.com/rekcurd) as my work on LINE. Rekcurd is a flexible managing system for machine learning models, and can be run on Kubernetes. Rekcurd makes it "easy to serve ML module", "easy to manage ML model and deploy ML module" and "easy to integrate into the existing service". The key concept is to be a developer-friendly software. Developers need not to be familiar with the recent technologies like gRPC and Kubernetes. WebUI supports managing a machine learning web service.

I am interested in the position which uses Kubernetes x Machine Learning.
